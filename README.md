# Ponyvania - Ukrainian translation | Поніванія - Український переклад
If folder has "regular_version" in it's title, that means that textures in that folder is 1-to-1 in terms of height and width size. So, if source texture is 100x100 px, then translated texture is also 100x100. But due to size limitations, translated texture might have meaning or quality loss compared to original. But easier to replace without any code rewriting.


If folder has "extended_version" in it's title, that means that translated texture is not 1-to-1 as source. If source might be 100x100px, translated might be bigger. They usually better in terms of meaning and quality, but since texture is bigger, it might rquire some code rewriting.
