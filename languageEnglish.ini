776="Trixie? Pay her no attention. She is of no importance."
777="The great and powerful Trixie? Oh! I love magic shows! It's amazing what ponies can do without using any unicorn magic."

666="do you like mmmm bananas?"

106="Thank you brave warrior. I cannot fully express just how much your valiant efforts have aided Equestria."
107="You have provided an invaluable service to us and I shudder to think what would have happened had you not been here."
108="We are eternally indebted to you."
109="Although I do wish you would stay a bit longer, I understand that you must be on your way."
110="Just remember that you are always welcome in Equestria."

104="It's over Discord!"
105="Quickly, we must leave! Without Discord, this dimension will soon cease to exist!"

103="Once you enter the Realm of Chaos, you will not be able to return until you weaken Discord. Be sure to make all the necessary preparations before you enter."

091="Luna and I were able to find where Discord is hiding."
092="If Luna and I combine our power, we should be able to open a doorway into that dimension."
093="There is another problem. The sheer chaotic nature of this dimension would likely destroy any pony who enters."
094="Only a powerful alicorn would be able to stay safe once inside."
095="Luna and I might be able to keep a single pony safe once they entered, but who could we send?"
095b="Luna and I might each be able to keep a pony safe once they entered."
096="Only the 6 can activate the Elements of Harmony, but they would all need to be present and we can only send in a single pony."
096b="However, we need to send all 6 in to activate the Elements of Harmony, and we can only send in 2 at a time."
097="Our only option is to send a pony in to battle Discord. If they can weaken him, his hold on the dimension will also weaken."
097b="Our only option is to send 2 ponies in to battle Discord. If they can weaken him, his hold on the dimension will also weaken."
098="..."
099="I'm sure you already know what I'm about to ask of you."
100="You've already done so much, and you've proven yourself to be a strong and valiant warrior."
100b="You two have already done so much, and you've proven yourselves to be strong and valiant warriors."
101="There is no pony else that I feel is more suited for this task than you."
102="Please. We beg you. Enter the Realm of Chaos and face Discord."

084="Thank you brave warrior. You have my eternal gratitude."
084b="Thank you brave warriors. You have my eternal gratitude."
085="That was Chrysalis, queen of the Changelings."
086="She imprisoned and impersonated me; likely as an act of revenge for her previous defeat."
087="And although her deception was short lived, she caused enough chaos in the land to free Discord."
088="It appears that after being freed, Discord escaped into another dimension. We'll have to track him down before we can confront him."
089a="Unfortunately that will have to wait. In her short reign, Chrysalis has caused much destruction and devastation throughout the land."
089b="Our first priority must be to restore order and peace to the land."
089c="If only some pony could have seen through her scheme and defended the inhabitants of the land from her attacks."
090="Where is Luna? We must gather those we can here so that we may pin point Discord's location."

073="Welcome, so you were able to make it up here after all."
074="You know, I was really hoping I wouldn't have to see you again."
075="I suppose that means that my sister and that pawn were completely useless."
076="Not that it really matters anymore; I've gotten what I came for."
077="What I've set into motion cannot be stopped now. This land will forever regret having crossed my path."
078="Yes, there's no need to keep up this charade any longer."
079="I want nothing more than for this land to be plunged into chaos."
080="And there's nothing you can do to stop that."
081="So what will you do now?"
082="Would you like for me to play with you for a bit?"
083="I'd be happy to oblige."

068="Dear little sister, did you really think that I wouldn't become aware of your treachery?"
069="This again? I thought I made myself clear the last time."
070="Hmm... that's a shame. I had hoped that you of all ponies would stand by me."
071="Very well then, you will get rid of this little pest that has been running around the castle."
072="Oh my dear sister. It wasn't a request..."

056="Thank you my little ponies. You've gathered all the elements of harmony for me."
057="Thank you my little pony. You've gathered all the elements of harmony for me."
058="Now with the elements once again in my possession, no pony will be able to stand in our way."
059="Don't look so surprised. There was never any danger of Discord breaking free. It was I who released him."
060="By unleashing monsters throughout Equestria and throwing its cities into chaos, Discord was able to break free from his stone imprisonment."
061="My only concern had been the elements. They could still be used against him. Somepony realized this and tried to conceal them from me."
062="I couldn't publicly reveal that they had been taken, otherwise some ponies might have suspected that something was wrong."
063="That's why I chose you two simpletons, so no one would suspect."
064="That's why I chose you to retrieve them. A simpleton of little concern."
065="I'm honestly quite surprised you made it this far. I was expecting to have to go through four or five others before I had all the elements again in my possession."
066="But it doesn't matter now. Your usefulness to me has ended."
067="Now if you'll excuse me, I have some important matters to attend to. Farewell."

049="Welcome back, it appears that thou have found yet another element. Now only one remains."
050="Regrettably, the situation grows more dire with each passing second. We are doing what we can, but we sense that Discord's escape is imminent."
051="It is imperative that the final element be found as swiftly as possible..."
052="We have received word that the final element lies within the city of Manehattan."
053="The city has been set ablaze by monster attacks. However, our sister should be there aiding with the civilian evacuation."
054="She may have already found the element, but even so, we ask thee to investigate the situation."
055="We await thy safe return."

034="Excellent work my faithful warriors, you've recovered another element of harmony."
035="It seems you three made the perfect team."
036="Excellent work my faithful warrior, you've recovered another element of harmony."
037="It seems you and your companion made the perfect team."
038="But we must move on, the monster infestations grow worse by the minute."
039="Excellent work on finding another element of harmony, but what about your companion?"
040="........."
041="I...see..."
042="I'm sorry. I'm sure you did everything you could. Her valiant efforts will be remembered..."
043="..."
044="...as much as it pains me to say, we must move on. We cannot let her sacrifice be in vain."
045="I received a report that a few guards spotted another element being taken by a group of monsters."
046="I ordered them to pursue the monsters and recover the element, but I have not heard back from them."
047="I fear the worst, so I'm sending you to their last known whereabouts: Ghastly Gorge. Please find them and recover the element if it's still there."
048="Now please excuse me, I must get back to the cities and make sure that their citizens are safe from monster attacks."

019="Good work on recovering another of the elements of harmony my little ponies, but I fear I have some dreadful news..."
020="Good work on recovering another of the elements of harmony my little pony, but I fear I have some dreadful news..."
021="Monsters have begun appearing in towns and cities. It seems that something is driving them from their natural habitats and into populated areas."
022="I suspect it has something to do with the elements of harmony and whomever was responsible for their disappearance."
023="I have begun working on evacuating all ponies from infested areas and driving the monsters back, but their numbers seem endless."
024="I cannot stress to you how important it is that you recover the remaining elements as soon as possible."
025="One was spotted in the possession of a monster that appeared in Cloudsdale, I'm sending you over to investigate."
026="Cloudsdale has already been evacuated but monsters are still swarming all around it."
027="I won't be sending you alone this time. A pegasus who is familiar with the area will accompany you."
028="Since you are a pegasus as well, it shouldn't be a problem for the two of you."
029="Since you are not a pegasus yourself, I will need to cast a spell that will allow you to walk on clouds."
030="Since both of you are pegasi as well, you shouldn't have any trouble finding it."
031="One of you will need a spell so that you can walk on clouds, I'll take care of it."
032="Since neither of you are pegasi, I will need to cast a spell that will allow you two to walk on clouds."
033="Good luck and please hurry."

011="This is indeed the element of kindness, good work. I expected no less from you."
012="Hold onto it for now. It will aid you in finding the rest of the elements."
013="Speaking of the elements, I have determined the location of another one. It is somewhere in Froggy Bottom Bog."
014="That area has become very dangerous recently, so exercise great caution."
015="If you don't feel adequately prepared, there's a traveling salespony that has stopped by."
016="He's selling some wares that you may be interested in. I've already spoken to him and he's agreed to give you a discount."
017="You can find him on your way down in the door to the left."
018="Also, don't forget to save your progress. Check the room on your right on your way down."

004="My little ponies, I summoned you here today because a great catastrophe looms over Equestria. I speak of Discord's return."
005="My little pony, I summoned you here today because a great catastrophe looms over Equestria. I speak of Discord's return."
006="As you know, the spirit of disharmony was sealed in stone by the elements of harmony; where he remains to this day."
007="However, the seal is weakening. I am doing all I can to hold him back, but I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before he breaks free."
008="Our only hope is to use the elements again to renew the seal, but I'm afraid that they are no longer in my possession. They were stolen."
009="And so I am charging you with the task of recovering them. I have determined that one of the elements is somewhere in the Everfree Forest."
010="I will stay here and continue searching for the rest of the elements. The best of luck to you."

003="Take care and remember: your actions can impact those around you."

001="Hurry now, time is of the essence."
002="If you have the chance, be sure to purchase a water of life. There's no guarantee you'll be able to find one out there."

000="Celestia"



[Filthy Rich]
004="Wait! Where are you two going?"
005="Wait! Where are you going?"
006="I saw everything, the princess... she..."
007="...but you're not thinking of going up against her are you?"
008="You're crazy! There's no way you can beat her!"
009="..."
010="Well, of course I don't want to see this land thrown into chaos and disorder... but what can we do?"
011="Do you really think this is something you can stop?"
012="..."
013="Well if you think there's even a glimmer of hope, I suppose I could support you with items and equipment..."
014="...but if the princess finds out I helped you... I'd be in some serious trouble..."
015="..."
016="Alright, I've decided to help you, for a price of course."
017="Hay! I'm taking a big risk here remember? And there's no point in you saving the world if I can't make a living right?"
018="Look, I'll give you these for free."
019="Look, I'll give you this for free."
020="It's a magic map. Once you enter Canterlot Castle, it will automatically fill in the rooms you've explored."
021="Oh, and take this with you too..."
022="If you need anything else, I'll be here."

002="Welcome! Please have a look around."
003="I've got some items here that might be useful on your quest."

001="If you need anything else, just let me know."

[Luna]
777="I'm afraid I've never heard of this Trixie, but from your description, I wouldn't mind watching one of her performances."

119="Incredible! You were able to overpower even the Tantabus!"
120="It hasn't been defeated, but it has been severely weakened. Thank you. I must give you something for your efforts. Please take this."
121="With this, the Tantabus is finally at rest. I should be able to keep it under control for now. Please take this as a token of my appreciation."

118="Oh! You've come with the lavender. Does that mean you wish to challenge the Tantabus?"

109="I'm impressed! You were able to defeat all of your past foes one after the other!"
110="Perhaps you are strong enough to contain it... hmm..."
111="I know you already have so much on your plate, but I would like to make personal request."
112="There is a... manifestation of darkness... deep inside myself that I am unable to completely erase."
113="I have managed to keep it dormant up until now, but recently is has begun stirring."
114="Would you once again enter the dream world to do battle with it?"
115="You need not defeat it, merely weaken it so that I can regain control over it."
116="There is one small caveat. You will not be able to damage it unless you equip this special item."
117="If you would like to take on my request, speak to me with the item equipped."

105="Well done! You were able to overpower all enemies; and you were able to complete this task in 0"
106="It was an honest attempt, but I feel that you are capable of much more. Next time, try to defeat all enemies in under 0"
107="I would like to give you a reward for this accomplishment. I also believe that if you put forth the effort, you may even be able to defeat them all in under 0"
108="Very impressive! I expected no less from you. Please accept this reward for your valiant efforts."

104="Do you wish to enter the dream world? What kind of challenge are you looking for?"

097="Are you feeling a ill-prepared? It's only natural. If you feel that you need more combat experience before you go, perhaps I can be of assistance."
098="My domain is dreams, and so I can create a dream world for you to train in before you leave for your final battle."
099="You'll be able to face all of your previous opponents in a controlled environment without any real danger."
100="Unfortunately, since it is just a dream, you will not gain things like bits from defeating monsters."
101="But perhaps I can help you there as well."
102="In order to motivate you to do your best, I will offer you special items as rewards if you perform well in these dream battles."
103="What do you think? If you would like to enter the dream world, come speak with me."

096="And we can rest easier knowing that even without the elements, there will always be ponies out there that will answer the call and fight to protect this magical land."

095="Now that we can activate the elements, you can't win!"

088="He has escaped into a dimension of his own creation. We are calling it the Realm of Chaos."
089="However, my sister and I must remain on this side to keep the doorway open. That means that neither one of us will be able to enter."
090="If it were not for Discord's control over the dimension, Celestia and I would both be able to activate the elements."
091="Then we could activate the elements and seal away Discord."
092="We will open the doorway for you."
093="Enter the painting once you are ready."
094="But be warned: You will not be able to escape from the dimension until Discord is defeated. Failure is not an option."

086="Thank you for saving me when I wasn't being myself."
087="I would have been lost without you."

067="Please... forgive us..."
068="Forgive us for being.... so pathetically weak..."
069="We...we were once again consumed by the darkness..."
070="..."
071="And now... it would seem that you will have to continue this journey on your own..."
072="We are unable to accompany you any further."
073="Our body is... broken..."
074="..."
075="It's quite comical really..."
076="We came here to offer you our aid, but in the end, we were the one who needed your help..."
077="..."
078="Listen..."
079="There isn't much time...you have to put an end this..."
080="In our current state.... we... we cannot offer anything of value."
081="Just go, there is nothing you can do for us here..."
082="And please...."
083="Do not think too poorly of our sister..."
084="She has always had everyone's best interests at heart."
085="There must be a reason for all of this. She... would... never..."

059="Good, you have arrived. We shall confront our sister together. I am certain that we will be able to get through to her this time."
060="Let's go..."
061="Celestia!?"
062="Sister please! We only wish to speak with you! You have to put a stop to all of this!"
063="Can't you see that what you are doing is destroying the land?"
064="What? No! I'd never!"
065="Aaaagh!"
066="N-no! Stay back! Please... g-get away from me!"

051="What? The elements? But how?"
052="Don't tell me you traveled to the Frozen North by yourself to retrieve them?!"
053="There is a terrible creature of darkness that is sealed there. It is truly fortunate that you were able to evade its detection."
054="Regardless, now that we have the elements, our sister will surely listen to our plea."
055="She had us place a barrier that prevented access to the upper chambers of this castle."
056="We shall lower the barrier, so that you may accompany us. We shall see Celestia together."
057="Now, take the elements and meet us at the place we have marked on your map."
058="We will be waiting."

032="Thank you. We apologize, we were unable to speak with you sooner due to our sister's watchful eye."
033="We should be concealed from her here, but we do not know for how long."
034="She is also aware that you are in the castle, but she does not view you as a threat, and so she has no plans to deal with you presently."
035="..."
036="Our sister has freed Discord. She claims that by combining Harmony and Chaos, she will be able to unify the world."
037="But by merely looking around now, we cannot see how. There is only destruction and ruin covering the land."
038="We do not know what has come over our sister. We have attempted to reason with her repeatedly, but she will not listen."
039="We... have begun to fear even approaching her now. With the Elements of Harmony in her possession, no pony can stand up to her."
040="If we could somehow take the elements from her, she would then certainly have to listen to our plea."
041="We are unable to do anything as it is, as she is monitoring our movements very carefully."
042="We know that this is much to ask of you, but we would need you to obtain the elements."
043="We have devised a plan. You see, she has hidden the elements somewhere in the Frozen North."
044="It would take years of searching to find them in that vast wasteland, but we know that there is a clue to their location hidden deep in the castle dungeons."
045="A monster in the abandoned mines under the castle guards the dungeon key."
046="You will have to defeat the monster, obtain the key, find the secret hidden in the dungeons, and recover the elements."
047="It is a tall order, but if anypony can do it, you can. I believe in you."
048="You should prepare well before you leave. I will bring the sales pony from the Order here, so please check back later."
049="Also, take this jewel. It will open certain doors in this castle."
050="Be careful and good luck!"

027="Returning to speak with our sister?"
028="Regrettably, she hath yet to return, and she did not leave any further instructions."
029="We received a report informing us that an element may be in the Appaloosan Mines."
030="This being our only clue, we suggest that thou investigate that area till our sister returns."
031="Best of luck to you."

023="Who goes there?"
024="...ah. So thou have been summoned by our sister."
024z="A foal? What does thou... wait..."
025="But wait. Dost that mean that thou art the ones chosen to..."
025z="No. Thou cannot be the one our sister hast summoned!"
026="We do not understand. Should not sister have sent..."
026z="This must be a mistake! She would not send a foal to..."

022="Wait! We do not wish to fight. Please listen to what we have to say."

019="Remember: Retrieve the dungeon key, and then find the location of the elements somewhere in the dungeon."
020="A monster in the abandoned mines under the castle guards the dungeon key."

017="Please forgive us. We wish there was more we could do."
018="Alas, the chaos and disorder these monsters have caused, has given great strength to Discord..."

015="We grow concerned for our sister."
016="However, we must remain hither in order to prevent Discord from escaping."

011="Our dear sister hath been very occupied with safeguarding the cities."
012="We have offered our aid, but she insists tis necessary for her to carry on alone."
013="We will remain hither and provide what assistance we can."
014="Strength is important in battle, but speed equally so. We bequeath thee this skill scroll."

009="Remember that the effectiveness of passive skills is determined by thy level."
010="Art thou having troubles finding items? This skill scroll should help thee."

006="Remember that intelligence increases the damage of all pony's skills, not just unicorns."
007="We heard that thou are looking to purchase items."
008="Please accept this small donation to thy quest."

004="May thy quest find success. We will remain hither and aid our sister."
005="Taketh this skill scroll; it may be of benefit on thy journey."

001="Make haste, our sister awaits thee."
002="Taketh this skill scroll; it may be of benefit on thy journey."
003="No, tis nothing. We art certain our sister is right in choosing thee."

[Gilda]
777="Look, I don't care about this Trixie pony alright? Why would I even know her?"

030="Hay this dog just brought over something in its mouth. I think it wants you to have it."

029="Are you really planning on going? Well just remember that you can't heal in there. But uh... let me know if you find anything."

022="That was for last time. Now we're even."
023="That was for being a jerk."
024="Anyway, when things got bad out there some creeps thought I was a monster and threw me in here."
025="This mutt looks mean but is actually pretty friendly. Seems to be keeping the monsters that are deeper inside from getting out."
026="There's also something weird about this place. If you go any deeper, your wounds don't heal."
027="So I think I'll hang around here till things cool down outside."
028="If you wanna go deeper into this place be my guest, but I ain't going."

021="Thanks."

020="...what...change your mind?"

018="Why? Why are you acting like this?"
019="Fine, be that way you jerk! I don't care! Do whatever you want! I don't need your help anyway. I don't need... anybody's help..."

017="Okay I'm sorry, alright! Is that what you wanted to hear? You win okay? Just let me out... please..."

016="No? You're... serious then? You're just going to leave me here?! You're not that heartless right? Come on, just let me out!"

015="Huh? This is a joke right? You're just pullin my wing. Okay, okay, I get it. Ha Ha... very funny. Now get me out!"

014="What? You can't refuse. You're a pony. You guys are all about friendship and stuff right? So be a pal and get me out of here!"

008="Psst... Hay you! Over here!"
009="Quick! Get me out of here before..."
010="Oh, it's you..."
011="Don't think I've forgotten what you did to me back there."
012="But, uh, you've caught me in a good mood. If you help me get out of here, I may be able to find it in my heart to forgive you."
013="So hurry up an get me out!"

001="Hay. What are a couple of dweebs like you doing way out here?"
002="Aren't the monsters around here a little too much for little ponies like you? So why don't you make like bees and buzz off."
003="Hay. What's a dweeb like you doing way out here?"
004="Aren't the monsters around here a little too much for a little pony like you? So why don't you make like a bee and buzz off."
005="...Huh? Oh, I get it. You're after this shiny little trinket I found. Well, I can tell you right now that you ain't gettin' it."
006="Unless of course you think you can beat me."
007="Come on, bring it on!"

777="Uh... Trixie? Isn't she the pony that put on that magic show in Ponyville that one time?"

021="Ah, sorry. That battle really took it out on me..."
022="If only I had brought something to eat."
023="Like this, I'm just going to slow you down, and you need to get that shiny necklace to the Princess!"
024="You go on ahead, I'll catch up."
025="Ah, sorry. I'm just a little tired... I've never had to carry another pony before..."
026="Hm? Oh! No, it's not your fault."
027="But I'm just going to slow you down, and you need to get that shiny necklace to the Princess!"

019="Huh? Is that..."
020="Don't worry! I'll be fine. I can take care of myself!"

018="Muffin!"

014="Good luck!"
015="..."
016="......"
017="I'm glad I was able to help..."

011="Mm, mm! It was a good one!"
012="Now I feel like I could do anything!"
013="Ok, let's get out of here."

007="This is the place but I don't see anything."
008="Maybe we're at the wrong spot? But I was sure this was it...#Did I mess up?"
009="Um... Maybe we should keep looking then..."
010="I'll let you know if I find anything. Be careful!"

005="I just don't know what went wrong."
006="There. I said it..."

003="Huh? I guess it's not over. You still have something to do."
004="But if you ever need to go back to Cloudsdale, just let me know! I'll help you out!."

001="I can't believe we're actually doing this! I'm so excited!"
002="I promise I won't let you down!"

[Zecora]
777="I have heard of Trixie's magic shows, stage magic is something she certainly knows."

007="Thank you for dealing with that pest, and completing my request."
008="There are many who are in your debt, but we aren't finished just yet."
009="I have more tasks for you, as well as a special brew."
010="Because of the monsters that now roam, I've moved into a new home."
011="When you have the time, come give me a chime."

006="Those glasses must be in your accessory slot, or else the hidden evil cannot be fought."

001="There is something you must know, allow me to inform you before you go."
002="I have felt something dreaded, in the place to where you are headed."
003="You will not be able to see it with your own eyes, it is an old darkness under a new guise."
004="These shadows you can cleanse, if you wear this magic lens."
005="Now hurry and make haste, this evil must be erased."

000="Zecora"



[Flash Sentry]
777="The great and powerful Trixie? Do you think she could help out with the monsters?"

031="Uh, say. You seem to handle yourself pretty well. Do you think you could go there and get back the princess's treasure?"
032="I'd go with you but, uh...#I've got to...#make sure the injured guards make it back safely."
033="It'll be rough, but I'm sure you can handle it."
034="If you think you need more training before you go, you can use our training halls."
035="Normally only royal guards are allowed in, but I'd say you're more than qualified."
036="I'll be waiting there if you decide to stop by. See ya!"

029="More monsters? And they're even worse that the ones in here? There's no way I'll make it..."
030="..."

028="Huh? What do you mean?"

026="Hmm... so you really didn't steal them then? But they do belong to the princess right?"
027="Alright then, if you give us the other one, we'll let you go."

025="What are you talking about?"

024="That's for the princess to decide. You're still going to have to come with us."

017="Sorry I'm late, I was taking care of the hurt guards."
018="Did you get the stolen item back? Great!"
019="What about the thieves? Where did they go?"
020="They got away? Well that's not good. We need to apprehend them."
021="Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You can go back and report to the princess."
022="I'll see you around!"
023="Not so fast! I'm afraid we're placing you under arrest for theft."

007="Huh?! Who are you two? How did both of you get down here?"
008="Huh?! Who are you? How did you get down here?"
009="..."
010="The princess sent you to help us? Oh thank goodness. We're going to need all the help we can get."
011="So I assume you already know what happened right? We got word that a couple of thieves stole a very valuable item from the princess."
012="Well we managed to chase them down here, but we weren't prepared for the monsters that are roaming around these parts."
013="There were 4 of us including me, but 2 of the others got lost somewhere in the tunnels up ahead."
014="We've tried searching for them, but we never make it very far because of all the monsters."
015="If you're going up ahead, can you keep an eye out for any guards that might be hurt?"
016="If you find them please give them this medicinal plant, it should give them enough strength to at least get out of here."

003="Hey, so you decided to check out our training grounds?"
004="You're welcome to try, but be warned: these are the training halls for our elite guards."
005="This is a test of raw skills, so that means that "

005f="flying, dashing, teleportation, and levitation"
005g="special movement"
005h=" techniques are not allowed."
006="If you think you're up to it, go on ahead."

001="I don't think I need to tell you to be careful. The monsters around here are really dangerous."
002="If you see any hurt guards, be sure you give them the medicinal plant I gave you."

[Rover]
014="Grr... fine... take gem. We didn't want it anyway."

012="We hide gem in one of our abandoned mines. But mine was full of monsters when we went back for it."
013="We show you where it is, but we won't go back there."

011="Uh... we can show you where, but we can't get it for you."

010="Yes! We found two of those pretty stones. If you let us go, we'll show you where the other is."

009="No! Wait! You like gems? We have another just like it!"

008="Ugh! We told you already, we didn't steal! We found it!"

001="Ugh, why won't you ponies give up? We already told you we're not going to..."
002="Wait... you're not the same ones as before..."
003="Wait... you're not the same one as before..."
004="There are more of you?! You ponies are so annoying!"
005="Grrr... we aren't handing over any of the gems we found!"
006="Hmm?"
007="Maybe we just need to teach you a lesson. Let's see if you ponies can still follow us after this..."

000="Rover"



[Apple Bloom]
017="So um? Can we go home now?"

012="Hay! You made it out too! Thanks so much for finding my friends!"
013="I guess going in there by ourselves was kind of a bad idea huh?"
014="You won't... tell anyone about this right?"
015="Oh! Here, we wanted to give you this map we found."
016="It leads to a mysterious cave. We were planning on exploring it, but I think we've all had enough spelunking for now."

001="Wh-who're you?"
002="..."
003="You came to explore the ruins too?"
004="I-I came here with my friends, we were trying to earn our cutie marks in..."
005="Huh? You want me to leave?!"
006="But my friends are still down here! I'm not going anywhere without them!"
007="..."
008="You'll look for them? You'll make sure they're all right?"
009="..."
010="A-Alright. I'll wait outside but you have to promise me you'll save them!"
011="I-I'll be waiting outside so hurry."

[Royal Guard]
777="Trixie? I don't think I've heard of her, but we royal guards don't get out much. It'd be great if we could take a day off and go see one of her shows."

077="Whoa! Under a minute and a half? That's insane!"
078="That's under 01:40! You beat my record!"
079="Amazing! That's under 02:00!"
080="Great! That's under 02:30!"
081="But if you can make it in under 01:40, you'll get an even rarer item!"
082="Next time, try to make it in under 02:00 and you'll get something better!"
083="Next time try and make it under 2:30. If you do, I'll give you a prize!"

075="That was a good run but I think you can do better."
076="Next time try and make it under 2:00. If you do, I'll give you a prize!"

060="Your time this run was 0"
061="Whoa! Under a minute? That's insane!"
062="You completely demolished my record!"
063="I'll have to give you one of our best items for that!"
064="That's under 01:10! You beat my record!"
065="I'll have to give you one of our best items for that run!"
066="There's nothing left for you to prove, but come back if you want to try for an even faster time."
067="Amazing! That's under 01:30!"
068="A run like that deserves a special item!"
069="But if you can make it in under 01:10, you'll get an even rarer item!"
070="That's my personal best so come back when you think you can beat it!"
071="Great! That's under 02:00!"
072="That's fast enough to get you an item."
073="Next time, try to make it in under 01:30 and you'll get something better!"
074="I'll be waiting!"

055="Congratulations! You made it past all the challenges!"
056="Unfortunately, this stopwatch only goes up to 10 minutes so I don't know your time."
057="These training halls can be tough huh?"
058="But you're gonna have to do a lot better if you want to qualify for the prizes."
059="Come back if you want to try again."

054="The princess is expecting you. Please go see her before you leave."
054z="I know you're scared but the princess is expecting you."

050="Great, now you can use skills."
051="Also, before you leave, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with your abilities. You can read about them in the pause menu."
052="Great, now you two can use skills."
053="Also, before you leave, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourselves with your abilities. You can read about them in the pause menu."

043="There you go! You can also equip armor and accessories in the same way."
044="I see you've also gone ahead and equipped some skills."
045="As a unicorn, skills will be your primary way of attacking. You should only fall back on your physical attacks when you run out of MP or you need to finish off a weak enemy."
046="As a pegasus, you want to use a good mix of regular attacks and skills. You don't have enough MP to rely solely on your skills, so remember to use your weapon as much as possible."
047="As an earth pony, your skills don't deal a whole lot of damage. They're mainly for giving you some extra range. You want to primarily use your weapon to attack."
047z="As a foal, both your weapon and skills can deal devastating damage. However, keep the limits of your tiny body in mind."
047y="As a bat pony, all of your attacks deal decent damage. Try using the attack that best suits the situation."
047x="As an Alicorn, you'll acquire new abilities on your adventure. You can change your special ability as well as enable and disable movement abilities from the ability menu."
048="Also be sure to familiarize yourself with your abilities. You can view them from the pause menu."
049="I see you two have also gone ahead and equipped some skills."

039="Unicorns primarily use skills to attack. They should only fall back on physical attacks when they run out of MP or need to finish off a weak enemy."
040="Pegasi should use a good mix of regular attacks and skills. Pegasi don't have enough MP to rely solely on skills, so they should use their weapon as much as possible."
041="Earth pony's skills give them extra range but don't deal a whole lot of damage. They should primarily use their weapon to attack."
041z="Foal's skills summon animals to attack enemies. They're powerful and can cover a lot of different angles."
041y="Bat pony's skills are mostly fire and dark based. They're good at dealing damage over time and striking multiple targets."
041x="Alicorn's skills come from defeating enemies and are incredibly versatile."
042="It would also be a good idea to try out your new skills before you leave."

037="Remember: Press XXXXXXXXXX and go back to the pause menu but this time select 'skills'."
038="Then just equip one of the available active skills or a passive skill."

030="You'll also definitely want to equip a few skills."
031="You'll also probably want to equip a few skills."
032="It also wouldn't hurt to equip a few skills."
033="Go back to the pause menu but this time select 'skills'."
034="You can equip 2 active skills and 1 passive skill at a time. The top 2 slots are for active skills and the bottom one is for the passive skill."
035="You can also set up to 3 different loadouts and then quickly switch between them without having to open the menu again. They are labeled A, B, and C"
036="Try equipping some skills to your current loadout."

028="Remember: press XXXXXXXXXX in order to bring up the pause menu and select 'equip' from the list of options."
029="Then simply select your hoof and choose the weapon you just received."

023="You'll need to equip those weapons before you can actually use them."
024="You'll need to equip that weapon before you can actually use it."
025="Press XXXXXXXXXX in order to bring up the pause menu and select 'equip' from the list of options."

025a="the start key"

022="Remember: press XXXXXXXXXX to open a chest."

018="You're not going out there like that are you? You don't even have a weapon!"
019="You two aren't going out there like that are you? You don't even have weapons!"
020="Here, take the one in this chest."
021="To open a chest, just press XXXXXXXXXX."
021a="the up key"

016="There were these 3 strange monsters that we saw make off with the item."
017="They move really fast underground but I think we finally tracked them down."

014="So you've finished this version of the game? There might be still be things you can do though."
015="Did you unlock everything?"

011="This Zebra claims to have come here to deliver an important message to Celestia."
012="The Princess isn't here, but you're on your way to meet her now aren't you?"
013="So could you deliver the Zebra's message to Celestia when you get there?"

009="In your travels, you may encounter stronger versions of enemies you've fought before. You'll be able to identify them by their different coloration."
010="Be careful, aside from having higher stats, some of them might even perform new attacks."

007a="Did you know that you can perform an uppercut in mid-air?"
007b="Did you know that you can teleport in mid-air?"
007c="Did you know that you can fly to reach higher ground?"
007d="Did you know that you can perform an uppercut or a teleport in mid-air?"
007e="As an earth pony, you can repeatedly perform uppercuts to reach even higher ground."
007f="As a unicorn, you can repeatedly teleport to reach even higher ground."
007g="Did you know that you can perform a Seiryu Ascent in mid-air?"
007h="As a foal, you can repeatedly use the Seiryu Ascent to reach even higher ground."
007i="Did you know that you can fly faster by pressing jump while in bat form?"
007j="As a bat pony, you can transform into a bat to reach higher ground."
007k="When you obtain a green ability from a monster, it goes into your ability menu."
008a="You can repeatedly perform uppercuts to reach even higher ground."
008b="You can repeatedly teleport to reach even higher ground."
008c="However, staying airborne for too long will begin to drain MP. Make sure to land every once in a while to prevent this from happening."
008d="You can repeatedly perform uppercuts or teleports to reach even higher ground."
008e="Also remember that flying for too long as a Pegasus will begin to drain MP. Make sure to land every once in a while to prevent this from happening."
008f="You can repeatedly use the Seiryu Ascent to reach even higher ground."
008g="You can transform into a bat to reach higher ground."
008h="You can toggle green abilities that you've obtained on and off from the ability menu."
008i="As an alicorn, you can adjust green abilities in the ability menu."

005="Now I'm not one to question the Princess's decisions but..."
006="I feel like there has to be another pony who is better suited for helping you on this important mission."

003="Did you know that the color an enemy flashes when hit reveals how effective an attack was?"
004="Red means that the attack did normal damage, blue means it wasn't so effective, and yellow means it was very effective."

002="All set? When you're ready to leave, take the door to the left."
002z="I can't stop you from leaving, but I'd just like to say that I think this is a terrible idea."

001="Welcome. The princess is waiting for you on the top floor."
001z="Hm. I really don't know what the princess is thinking calling for a child."

000="Royal Guard"



[Trixie]
100="Wait... that get up..."
101="Are you trying to impersonate Trixie?!"
102="Oh!"
103="No, you must you one of Trixie's adoring fans!"
104="That's a very flattering cosplay of Trixie. Your devotion is admirable!"

093="Come back to see Trixie?"
094="Well it so happens that Trixie has a proposition for you."
095="You see, Trixie has years of experience with stage magic."
096="As such, she has great proficiency in creating contraptions and props for her shows."
097="For helping her, Trixie extends these crafting services to you. You should be grateful!"
098="Bring Trixie the required items, and for a small fee, Trixie will create fantastic new items for you to use."
099="New items that are crafted will have all the effects and abilities of all the items used to create them. Amazing!"

072="You! How dare you..."
073="You're standing in the way of everything I've worked so hard for!"
074="I'll...I'll KILL you!"
075="..."
076="N-no!"
077="What am I saying?!"
078="This isn't Trixie!"
079="The amulet... Trixie could feel it taking hold of her..."
080="You... did you come here to help Trixie?"
081="..."
082="No, it's the princess you've been trying to help this whole time. Right?"
083="Actually, I felt something was off with the Princess but..."
084="It just felt like a once in a lifetime opportunity when the Princess requested Trixie's help."
085="..."
086="So..."
087="I trust that you'll keep this little incident confidential."
088="After all, Trixie has a reputation to maintain!"
089="A-Anyway, now that that's settled, we still have to face the princess."
090="Trixie will need to make the necessary preparations."
091="Of course, you'll continue to assist Trixie in her adventure, right?"
092="Trixie will return shortly, so don't go losing the fight before then, alright?"

057="Stop right there intruder! None shall..."
058="What? How did you make it up here?!"
059="You're beginning to annoy Trixie with your persistence. Leave here immediately."
057b="Stop right there intruders! None shall..."
058b="What? How did you two make it up here?!"
059b="You're both beginning to annoy Trixie with your persistence. Leave here immediately."
060="..."
061="No. The princess specifically ordered not to let anyone through here."
062="Yes you heard right! Princess Celestia recognized my abilities and immediately appointed me as a distinguished guard for the royal chamber."
063="With me by her side, we will restore order to the land!"
064="..."
065="What?! You're saying that Celestia is behind all of this?"
066="But then... my appointment as a guard... was that just..."
067="No..."
068="No! You're lying!"
069="You're just jealous! Yes, that's it!"
070="You're jealous of Trixie!"
071="I won't be fooled by your lies! You're the real enemy!"

047="Ugh... this is taking forever."
048="If only..."
049="Right on cue!"
050="Listen, Trixie is getting through this castle just fine, but things could be progressing a little bit faster."
051="Luckily, Trixie has learned a new skill that can help! It's called Experience Drain."
052="Now you'll be able to assist Trixie directly by offering up some of your strength!"
053="Don't worry, the process is (I assume) quick and painless!"
054="Just hold still."
055="There, it's done! See? That wasn't so bad."
056="Now Trixie will be able to take her place beside Princess Celestia as Trixie's abilities are finally recognized by all!"

034="Ugh... this equipment just isn't doing the trick anymore."
035="Should've brought the..."
036="Hmm?"
037="You again? You're a persistent little one, aren't you?"
037a="You again? You're a persistent pair, aren't you?"
038="But Trixie appreciates your loyalty! Believe it or not, there are some neigh-sayers who doubt Trixie's prowess."
039="Oh! But since you're here, how would you like to express your unending loyalty by donating to Trixie's cause?"
040="Trixie will even reward you with a special treasure if you do!"
041="The minimum donation amount is a measly 10000 bits. Trixie isn't asking for more than that."
042="So run home and open up that piggy bank. Trixie will be waiting!"
043="You still don't have the bits!? There is a limit even to Trixie's patience! Hurry up! Trixie can't be expected to stand here waiting forever!"
043a="Did you bring the bits?"
044="It's really just pocket change for you, right?"
045="Oh! Your loyalty is very much appreciated. Now for that special treasure Trixie promised..."
046="And with that Trixie continues her journey to vanquish the evil from this land!"

009="Ugh... there's no end to these monsters."
010="This might prove to be a little more difficult than Trixie first thought..."
011="What? Who dares sneak up to The Great and Powerful Trixie?!"
012="Oh, it's you again. The little pony from the entrance, right?"
012a="Oh, it's you again. The little ponies from the entrance, right?"
013="What are you still doing here? Didn't Trixie tell you to leave this castle?"
014="Wait..."
015="Oh... I get it."
016="You must be one of Trixie's adoring fans!"
016a="You must be two of Trixie's adoring fans!"
017="Such devotion! You put your own life on the line just to be able to bask in Trixie's radiance!"
018="Well now, Trixie simply must reward such dedication!"
019="Hmmm..."
020="Yes! Trixie has thought of an amazing reward for you!"
021="Trixie will allow you to render her assistance!"
022="Just think: little old you will be helping Trixie save all of Equestria!"
023="Incredible yes? All you must do is bring Trixie a certain item."
024="Trixie is a little thirsty, run and get her a Water of Life."
025="It must be Water of Life. Normal water simply does not meet Trixie's high standards."
026="Now hurry along. Trixie will be waiting."
027="Incredible yes? All you must do is give Trixie one of your items."
028="Trixie is a little thirsty, hand over that Water of Life."
029="Normal water simply does not meet Trixie's high standards."
030="You still haven't gotten a Water of Life? Trixie will dehydrate if you take much longer! Hurry up!"
031="Finally! What took you so long? Give it to Trixie now."
032="Phew. That was a close one..."
033="Er... well done! You've played your part, now Trixie will be able to save the day!"

001="Have no fear citizens!"
002="The Great and Powerful Trixie is here to save you!"
003="These monsters are no match for..."
004="Oh? You're the only one here? How disappointing..."
004a="Oh? You're the only ones here? How disappointing..."
005="There should be more ponies here to witness Trixie's moment of triumph!"
006="But I suppose that's fine for now. After all, soon every pony will know of Trixie's greatness!"
007="Well, run along then. This castle is far too dangerous right now for someone like you."
008="Be sure to tell all your little friends how amazing The Great and Powerful Trixie was!"

000="Trixie"



[Chrysalis]
001="Ugh... Why you little..."
002="Heh, that's right. It's me. I fooled you all into thinking I was your pathetic princess."

005="Perhaps the same could be said of Princess Celestia."

001="What are you doing here?"
002="A fellow explorer? You sure don't look like one."
003="Well if you came here looking for the artifact, you're too late. It's mine."

005="..."
005a="Huh...well that's an amazing coincidence."
005d="Sorry, but I'm not going to repeat that name."
006="So you're just an adventurer who's exploring the gardens?"
006a="And I suppose you're hear to explore the gardens as well?"
006d="Anyway, are you here to explore the ruins?"
007="Well I don't blame you. I think there's still a lot of old secrets hidden within these ruins."
008="Did you know that they were built by a long forgotten civilization? That's probably why ponies call them the forgotten gardens now."
009="Me? I'm Starlight Glimmer. I came looking for an artifact in these old gardens."

014="What? You want this ZZZZZZZZZZ?"
015="Well I'm not particularly attached to it, but I'm not just going to give it away either."
016="How about you offer me a trade?"
017="Let's see what you have..."
018="Goodness! That's a lot of dangerous weapons you're carrying around!"
019="What's this one? The Staff of Sameness? Hmm..."
020="You say it steals talent? But isn't it just an ordinary piece of wood? That's very interesting..."
021="Unfortunately, it's not exactly what I'm looking for."
022="How can you even carry all this stuff?"
023="This is certainly quite the collection."
024="Well, while you do have a lot of weapons, none of them are really what I'm looking for."
025="But I've just thought of something."
026="The monsters around here are no joke, so you must be pretty strong to make it here."
027="Maybe you'd like to help me field test some of my spells."
028="See, I've created a number of spells, but I haven't found a strong enough opponent that would warrant using them."
029="So, how about we have a little duel? If you win, I'll give you the ZZZZZZZZZZ."
030="If I win... well... just knowing that my spells work as intended is reward enough for me."
031="How about it? Want to have a quick match?"
032="Come back for more? I'm ready if you are."
033="Alright! Don't hold back. Because I'm not going to..."
034="STOP! That's enough! I give up, you win!"
035="Sigh..."
036="Even after all that studying and training, I still lost."
037="Well here's the ZZZZZZZZZZ, as promised."
038="I guess what they say is true. No matter how strong you are, there's always going to be someone stronger."
039="..."
040="But maybe..."
041="...I don't need to be stronger. What if everyone was just weaker... than me?"
042="Yes, if everyone else was made equal then..."
043="Oh!"
044="Sorry, I was just thinking out loud."
045="It looks like our duel here was beneficial for the both of us."

777="Ah yes, Trixie. She was written as male in the premise, but the powers that be requested a female character."

074="You already have the 'ultimate weapon' in your possession, but if you want to take the test again I won't object."

073="Now if there is anything left for you to prove, prove it now."

068="Yes. I've always known that this day would arrive."
069="You've faced trial after trial, setback after setback."
070="Yet despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds, you never gave up."
071="You've passed my test and proven that you are ready to wield the 'ultimate weapon'."
072="And so now, I hereby bestow this weapon onto you."

067="You've gathered all 13 weapons, are you ready for your test?"

060="So you've arrived. I've been expecting you for some time now."
061="You've certainly gone above and beyond of what was required of you and now you're no doubt looking for something more."
062="Someone like you will surely eventually seek something like 'the ultimate weapon'."
063="I can bestow such a weapon to you but only if you are able to successfully complete my test."
064="But before that, I must make sure that you are ready. I ask that you collected 13 legendary weapons."
065="If you are capable of wielding these 13 weapons, then I'll know that you are ready for the test."

058="If you would like to take the test, you first must prove to me that you are capable of wielding the 'ultimate weapon'."
059="Return to me once you've collected all the legendary weapons pictured above."

050="It's seems you've forgotten about some of your friends. You won't be able to get much further without them."
051="If your friend is hungry, make sure you leave them something to eat. Especially if that something is their favorite food."
052="You should tend to the wounds of those who are injured. They may be able to return the favor someday."
053="Protect the children because they cannot protect themselves. If you find a lost child somewhere, their friends are sure to be nearby."
054="When a friend gives you a present, make sure that you use it. The gift may let you see a problem that you couldn't see before."
055="Even when a friend is consumed by the darkness, they aren't a lost cause. When they are in a weakened state, please don't hurt them. Instead, just wait for them to show you a sign of remorse."
056="Even the most stubborn and selfish can be softened with kindness. Keep doing what you can for them while you are on speaking terms. It may take 3 attempts to reach them."
057="Don't give up, and instead try again!"

046="I'm impressed you've found this place. I wasn't expecting any pony to find it so soon."
047="Unfortunately since you're here early, there isn't much for you to do now."

040="Very well, then please take this water of life. Use it to get past this area."

039="Well then, you know the drill..."

038="Well here's yet another portal that you can make use of."

037="Well here's another portal, remember that it takes you to the boss."

035="Fine, please consider entering this portal then."
036="With it, you can go directly to the boss."

033="In that case, I will create another portal for you."
034="Enter it if you want to go directly to the boss and fight it."

031="Very well, then I will create this portal for you. Please consider entering it."
032="It will take you directly to the boss so that you can fight it at full strength."

030="We meet again. You really should lower the difficulty."

027="Having trouble again? This area can be challenging."
028="Please just lower the difficulty."

025="It looks like you're also struggling in this area. It might be beyond your ability."
026="You should lower the difficulty."

023="You seem to be having some trouble there. You might have set the bar a little too high for yourself."
024="Do you want to lower the difficulty?"

021="I commend your determination, but you must acknowledge the fact that you aren't skilled enough to play at this difficulty."
022="It would be pointless to continue on like this. Please consider lowering the difficulty."

020="You aren't going to prove anything this way. Lower the difficulty now."

019="...sigh..."

017="I can't believe you're still here."
018="I have nothing else to say to someone who won't listen to reason."

015="You seem to enjoy torturing yourself, because you clearly aren't going to get passed this area."
016="And if by some miracle you make it through, it certainly won't be due to your skills, because you simply don't have any."

013="Look, I'll be frank with you: you're terrible at this. You're only embarrassing yourself."
014="You aren't going to prove anything this way. Just skip this area."

011="I admire your perseverance, but you simply lack the skills necessary to beat this area."
012="There is no shame in acknowledging your limits. Please consider skipping ahead."

010="Here we are yet again..."

009="We meet again. Do you need to skip ahead?"

008="Stuck again? I suppose you'll want to skip this area."

006="Having trouble again? This area can be tough for the inexperienced."
007="Do you want to skip it?"

004="Looks like this area is also giving you trouble. It could be above your skill level."
005="Do you want to skip this area? Remember that it will go on your permanent record."

Because of the#power that their queen had#drained, not even Celestia or#Luna were a match for her.#Then, when even the elements#of harmony failed to stop her,#it was the power of true love#that finally defeated her.##Shortly after that incident,#those in positions of power#at the time began to search#for new ways to counter any#evil that may rise again.##The Order, was born then#as one of those countermeasures.##Day after day, they conducted#their studies diligently, but failed#to produce satisfactory results.##But just when they seemed on#the verge of a breakthrough,#the elements of harmony vanished.#Without them, and without a#reliable substitute, there would#be nothing to stop Discord#when he eventually returned."
